### Hi there 👋

🌱 I'm a PhD candidate working on population genetics at Paris-Saclay University.

My GitHub account ID, @Creeki, is a fusion of "creek" and "i". I've chosen this name in tribute to the wisdom expressed by Laozi in the _Tao Te Ching_: "上善若水, 水利万物而不争", which translates to "The highest virtue is like water, benefiting all and contending with none."
